### üìò **Plan for Video Hosting Application**

I will implement a complete video hosting system using Spring Boot, following clean architecture principles and a modular MVCS (Model-View-Controller-Service) design. The platform will support core functionalities including user management, video uploads, asynchronous transcoding, and direct video streaming.

I will create core modules such as:

- **UserService** and **UserController** ‚Äì to handle user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **VideoService** and **VideoController** ‚Äì to manage video uploads, retrieval, and asynchronous transcoding initiation.
- **TranscodingService** ‚Äì to perform asynchronous transcoding of videos using FFmpeg, updating video statuses based on processing outcomes.
- **StreamingController** ‚Äì to serve video files directly from a designated directory, enabling real-time video playback.
- **GlobalExceptionHandler** ‚Äì to centrally manage exceptions across the application, ensuring meaningful error responses.

The application will expose REST APIs for all operations and use asynchronous processing (via @Async) for transcoding tasks, ensuring responsive endpoints even during long-running processes. I will enforce input validation using Spring‚Äôs validation framework and document DTOs where applicable. Logging will be implemented with Slf4j, taking care not to log sensitive data.

Security will be enforced via Spring Security with HTTP Basic authentication for initial development, and CORS will be configured to support frontend integrations. The codebase will follow clean coding standards with comprehensive inline documentation for easy maintainability and scalability.

I will write unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito for all services and repositories, and integration tests using @SpringBootTest + @AutoConfigureMockMvc to simulate end-to-end flows, including user registration, video upload, transcoding, and streaming. Optional performance testing will be considered using tools like Apache JMeter to ensure the system handles high load and concurrent requests efficiently.

## 5.üöÄ Access the API Endpoints

> Use cURL or Postman to interact with the cache API:

> Replace `localhost:8080` with your running host.


üîπ **1. Create a User**
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/users/register' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "secret",
  "role": "USER"
}'
```

üîπ **2. Upload a Video**
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/videos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "title": "Sample Video",
  "description": "A sample video upload.",
  "filePath": "/path/to/sample.mp4",
  "status": "PENDING"
}'
```

üîπ **3. Trigger Video Transcoding**
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/videos/transcode/1?format=mp4'
```

üîπ **4. Get All Videos**

curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/videos'
```

üîπ **5. Stream a Video**  
Replace `sample.mp4` with the actual file name stored in your video directory.
```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/stream/sample.mp4' --output streamed_sample.mp4
```

###  Time and Space Complexity Analysis

---
Below is a high-level analysis of time and space complexity for the key API endpoints in the application:

---

**User API Endpoints (UserController)**

- **Create/Register User:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
    The operation involves creating a new user record and saving it to the database (assuming average-case constant time for the database insert).
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
    Only the new user record is stored temporarily during the operation.

---

**Video API Endpoints (VideoController)**

- **Get All Videos:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
    Retrieving all videos requires scanning the database table, where _n_ is the number of video records.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
    The response contains all video records, so memory usage scales with _n_.

- **Upload Video:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
    Saving a new video record generally executes in constant time with respect to the number of videos (assuming the database insert is efficient).
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
    Only one video record is processed and stored.

- **Trigger Video Transcoding (Asynchronous):**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1) for initiating the asynchronous process.  
    The immediate API call only updates the status and triggers a background job; the actual transcoding process depends on the file size and FFmpeg processing time, which is external to the API call.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
    The API only handles status updates; any intermediate memory usage during transcoding is managed by the FFmpeg process and is independent of the API.

---

**Streaming API Endpoints (StreamingController)**

- **Stream Video:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(fileSize) if the entire file is read into memory; however, in practical streaming implementations the file is typically streamed in chunks, reducing the effective per-request overhead.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1) to O(chunkSize) per request  
    With chunked streaming, only a small portion (or a fixed chunk) of the video is kept in memory at any time rather than loading the full file.
