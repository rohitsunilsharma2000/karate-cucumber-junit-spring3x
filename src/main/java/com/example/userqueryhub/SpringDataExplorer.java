/**
 * **Goal:**
 * To build a robust, scalable Spring Boot service capable of efficiently removing user entities from the database by calling
 * {@code userRepository.delete(user)}. The solution ensures high data integrity through stringent input validation, comprehensive logging,
 * and clear exception management, ultimately delivering a reliable deletion process that is easily maintained and scalable.
 *
 * **Title:**
 * UserPurge System — Spring Boot User Deletion Service
 *
 * **High-Level Description:**
 * The UserPurge System is a Spring Boot application that provides a dedicated service for deleting user entities from a relational database.
 * Leveraging Spring Data JPA, the application focuses on the deletion process by retrieving a user entity and invoking the repository's
 * {@code delete(user)} method to remove it. The system is designed with a layered architecture that includes a service layer, repository,
 * and custom exception handling, ensuring robust error management and data integrity.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * 1. **Project Structure & Setup**
 *    - Built using Spring Boot with essential dependencies such as Spring Data JPA and an embedded database (H2) for development and testing.
 *    - Organized into clearly defined packages: {@code model}, {@code repository}, {@code service}, and {@code exception}.
 *
 * 2. **Service Layer – User Deletion**
 *    - Implements user deletion by first retrieving the user entity and then calling {@code userRepository.delete(user)}.
 *    - Includes validation checks to ensure the user exists before attempting deletion, preventing unintended errors.
 *
 * 3. **Exception Handling & Input Validation**
 *    - Utilizes custom exceptions (e.g., {@link com.example.userqueryhub.exception.UserNotFoundException}) to handle cases where a user is not found.
 *    - Integrates global exception handling to provide meaningful error responses and maintain application stability.
 *
 * 4. **Logging & Traceability**
 *    - Employs SLF4J for logging to capture key events during the deletion process.
 *    - Logs important steps and error conditions at various log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) to facilitate troubleshooting and ensure transparency.
 *
 * 5. **Testing & Documentation**
 *    - Comprehensive unit and integration tests are implemented to ensure high code coverage and reliable functionality.
 *    - Detailed Javadoc and inline comments support maintainability and scalability, making it easier for developers to understand and enhance the system.
 *
 * This class serves as the entry point for the UserPurge System, bootstrapping the Spring Boot application context and initializing all components.
